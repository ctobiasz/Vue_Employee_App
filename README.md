# Vue-Employee-App

##### Description
A simple dashboard that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations.
This project was a code along, created to teach the many aspects to a Vue project (components, data-binding and etc)

While this project is a direct copy of a tutorial, I added additional functionality to ensure that I grasped the concepts.

If you would like to run this application, simply:

1) ```npm install```

2) ```npm run serve```
